string input
string output
string prev_input
string input_sequence
# The input_sequence is a list of strings representing the sequence of inputs processed by the node.
# It is used to track the history of inputs for verification purposes.
# The state is an integer representing the current state of the verification node.
# The output is a string representing the result of the verification process.
# The prev_input is a string representing the previous input processed by the node.
# The state can be used to determine the current status of the verification process.
# The input is the current input being processed by the node.
# The output can be 'true', 'false', or 'waiting' based on the verification logic.
# The input_sequence is used to keep track of the sequence of inputs for backtracking and verification purposes.
# The node can backtrack to a previous state if the output is 'false',
# allowing for a more flexible verification process.
